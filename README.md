# Introduction

Many important things aren't known for sure, but can be estimated.  What will the global economy be in 5 years? How quickly will Global Warming occur? Exactly how big is the universe? These questions have been approximated; and while these approximations aren't exact, they are still very useful for making decisions.

A subset of similar questions can be very well approximated by simple machine learning. These are typically very repeatable events with a lot of existing data. However, many important questions come from very novel circumstances that would be hard to use direct data analysis on.  We don't have a long table of similar planets that have experienced similar economic and technological conditions, or a table of similar universes and their sizes.

Fortunately, our understanding of the universe has led to a host of predictive models that we can apply to novel sitatuions to result in our predictions of unknown variables. Some of these are mathematical, (F=ma), others are more heuristical (an increase in buyers is correlated with increases in price under specific conditions.)

In this paper we propose a terminology & structure for discussing large systems of equations and numeric inputs that model sets of desired outputs that are expected to have uncertainty. We focus on structures that collections of humans would be able to build and understand, and computer systems that could assist in their creation and analysis.
