# Holistic Estimation Systems
By Ozzie Gooen

In this paper we outline the idea of Holistic Estimation Systems, a structured approach of mathematical modeling aimed to help reduce uncertainty of many variables. These have two primary distinctions. First, uncertainty is accounted for in accordance to a specified set of rules. Second, large networks of models are connected and used to understand many variables over time. These ideas can be understood separately (we call these Estimation Models and Holistic Systems), but we think that their combination provides unique and powerful benefits.

Holistic Estimation Systems are meant and optimized for the use of humans making intuitive judgements.
