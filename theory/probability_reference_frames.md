# Probability Reference Frames

You hear on the news, "The chances of it raining tomorrow are 38%."

What does this mean?

Probabilities are commonly reported absent from their contexts, which gives the implications that they are objective and not dependent on someone's conditions. Pragmatically speaking, they never are.

When a weather service says the chances of it raining are "38", what they really mean is some more like,

"From the perspective of our weather team, and given their limitations of information, techniques, and time, the probability of it raining tomorrow is 38%."

In this case the reporter may have a different perspective. They could follow up that statement with, "but from my perspective, it seems to be a bit lower.  Our weather team typically reports numbers that are too low.  I would estimate the chances are between 32% and 40%."

One may be confused at this point and ask what percent it **really** is. Is it 38%, 32%, 40%? Can it be a range? But this is in some ways to miss the point.

With an infinitely precise measuring tool and knowledge of the universe, it may be possible to exactly predict the state of rainfall tomorrow. There would either be a 0% chance or a 100% chance. So the 'true' probability may be either 0% or 100%. But that's not a very useful thing to imagine about. From our perspective of only having information about what the news reporter reported, the chances that a perfect prediction machine would predict a 100% chance, is around 38%. In a way, we're back where we started.

Probabilities exist relative to specific amounts of information, and only are interesting (not 0% or 100%) in cases of non-perfect information.

Now, one interesting term mentioned above is the idea that the probability is between "32% and 40%." What does that mean?
