# Uncertainty Accounting

It is important that metric values reflect what their readers regard as reasonable values, without requiring further intuitive modification.  For instance, if one would have the result of a function be "34 to 38", but it's author considers that to biased on the low end due to experimental conditions, then they should specifically add a numeric filter to transform it into a range that they would agree with.

Uncertainty can come not only from experimental conditions, but also from bias, 

Here are some sources of uncertainty

## Communication Misunderstandings

## Communication Vagueness

## Experimental Errors

## Differences in Reference Classes

## Differences in Intervention

## Structural Uncertainty
## 

## Expected Motivation / Bias

## Uncertainty of Uncertainty
Many of the recommended methods for adjusting estimates for uncertainty are themselves approximations and have uncertainty.
