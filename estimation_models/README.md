# Estimation Models

The first aspect of Holistic Estimation Systems is what we call Estimation Models. Estimation Models are a type of mathematical model made for humans to systematically reduce uncertainty on valued variables. While particularly useful when done in large collections, they can also be used in smaller or independent sections.

## Features
- The use of probability distributions as the values of metrics.
- Careful accounting of metric uncertainty through functions.
- Aggregation methods to combine different ways of estimating individual metrics.
- The use of *contectual adjustment* in order for metrics values to be as accurate as possible, given human understanding.
