# Principal Features
- Careful accounting of uncertainty of computed metrics through sets of functions
- The presence of many (over 20) functions, inputs, and outputs.
- The use of improving & tracking important metrics over periods of time, rather than for one specific project

The large size & timeline is pragmatic for the careful uncertainty account for two reasons.  First, uncertainty accounting allows for very large models.  Second, the creation of large models takes more resources than for small models.  These are more worthwhile when the modeling can be reused for multiple purposes and at different times. Therefor we think that is useful to fit these different needs into one type of system.
