## Applied Information Economics
[Applied Information Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_information_economics) is a method of decision analysis created by Douglas W. Hubbard. It focusses on using human estimations of confidence to produce probability distributions and perform math on them with Monte Carlo Simulations. It provides the foundation of what we call Estimation Models. The primary book on the topic is [How to Measure Anything](https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/1118539273/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476304458&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+measure).

## Probability Management
The broad discipline of how to understand and perform math with probability intervals goes by the name of Probability Management. There is an official [Probability Management](http://probabilitymanagement.org/) nonprofit that promotes the topic. The book [The Flaw of Averages: Why We Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty](https://www.amazon.com/Flaw-Averages-Underestimate-Risk-Uncertainty/dp/1118073754/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476304693&sr=8-1&keywords=the+flaw+of+averages) by Sam L. Savage (also the founder of the Probability Management organization) discusses the topic in detail.

## Prediction Markets
While many human judgements and estimates [can be mediocre](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Political-Judgment-Good-Know/dp/0691128715/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1476304934&sr=1-2), there is evidence that certain conditions can help significantly.  Philip E. Tetlock has done extensive research regarding conditions and markets where individuals can do quite well at forecasting the future.  The book [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Prediction-Philip-E-Tetlock/dp/0804136718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476304759&sr=8-1&keywords=superforecasting) goes into detail about these techniques.

## Futarchy
[Robin Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson), a professor who has researched and promoted the ideas of prediction markets, has argued for a system of government called [Futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html). In this system people 'vote on values, but bet beliefs.' One challenge with Futarchy is that it can be quite complicated to model the relationships between values and beliefs in ways that optimize for good decisions.

We propose that Holistic Estimation Systems could be used to structure the mathematical understanding of a set of causal relationships in order to realize how important many different metrics are to predict. We also propose that very similar ideas could be used to optimize agents outside of large governments.

## Graphical Assumption Modeling
Ozzie Gooen has previously [written](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lhf/graphical_assumption_modeling/) about earlier versions of this called *Graphical Assumption Modeling.* This focussed on a method for displaying graphs of models similar to what we call Estimation Models.
