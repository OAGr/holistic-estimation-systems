### Applied Information Economics
[Applied Information Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_information_economics) is a method of decision analysis created by Douglas W. Hubbard. It focusses on using human estimations of confidence to produce probability distributions and perform math on them with Monte Carlo Simulations. It provides the foundation of what we call Estimation Models. The primary book on the topic is [How to Measure Anything](https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/1118539273/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476304458&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+measure).

### Probability Management
The broad discipline of how to understand and perform math with probability intervals goes by the name of Probability Management. There is an official [Probability Management](http://probabilitymanagement.org/) nonprofit that promotes the topic. The book [The Flaw of Averages: Why We Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty](https://www.amazon.com/Flaw-Averages-Underestimate-Risk-Uncertainty/dp/1118073754/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476304693&sr=8-1&keywords=the+flaw+of+averages) by Sam L. Savage (also the founder of the Probability Management organization) discusses the topic in detail.

### Prediction Markets
While many human judgements and estimates [can be mediocre](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Political-Judgment-Good-Know/dp/0691128715/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1476304934&sr=1-2), there is evidence that certain conditions can help significantly.  Philip E. Tetlock has done extensive research regarding conditions and markets where individuals can do quite well at forecasting the future.  The book [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Prediction-Philip-E-Tetlock/dp/0804136718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476304759&sr=8-1&keywords=superforecasting) goes into detail about these techniques.

### Futarchy
[Robin Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson), a professor who has researched and promoted the ideas of prediction markets, has argued for a system of government called [Futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html). In this system people 'vote on values, but bet beliefs.' One challenge with Futarchy is that it can be quite complicated to model the relationships between values and beliefs in ways that optimize for good decisions.

We propose that Holistic Estimation Systems could be used to structure the mathematical understanding of a set of causal relationships in order to realize how important many different metrics are to predict. We also propose that very similar ideas could be used to optimize agents outside of large governments.

### Systems Theory
Many ideas from Holistic Estimation Systems are borrowed from concepts in [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory). Systems theory is an interdisciplinary field of the study of "systems in general." In practice, much of the focus was on feedback systems, which are explicitly not a main element of Holistic Estimation Systems. However, Holistic Estimation Systems are systems, and many systems theory terms (Black box, complexity, holism, etc.) are used here.
 
### Programming
Functional programming paradigms have popularized specific function techniques used in Holistic Estimation Systems. Holistic Estimation Systems favor pure and immutable functions, as well as localized and restricted state (input metrics). 

### Uncertainty Quantification
[Uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification) is a large and well studied topic or characterizing and reducing uncertainties. It primarily focusses on experimental and computational analyses. In comparison, the categorizing of uncertainty in Holistic Estimation Systems focusses more on areas of human bias and miscommunication.

### Meta-Analyses
[Meta-analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis) are statistical analyses that aggregate multiple scientific studies on one topic. It's also a well studied area, though has traditionally focussed on comparing various scientific studies, as opposed to individual estimates. We think that the results of meta-analyses are useful and can be combined in Holistic Estimation Systems.  Holistic Estimation Systems use methods of estimation combination that are inspired by meta-analyses, but focussed more on human estimates and combining very different kinds of sources.

### Graphical Assumption Modeling
Ozzie Gooen has previously [written](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lhf/graphical_assumption_modeling/) about earlier versions of this called *Graphical Assumption Modeling.* This focussed on a method for displaying graphs of models similar to what we call Estimation Models.
