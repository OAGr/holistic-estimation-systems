# Background

Many important things aren't known for sure, but can be estimated.  What will the global economy be like in 5 years? How quickly will Global Warming occur? Exactly how big is the universe? These questions have been approximated; and while these approximations aren't exact, they are still very useful for making decisions.

A subset of similar questions can be very well approximated by simple machine learning. These are typically very repeatable events with a lot of existing data. However, many important questions come from very novel circumstances that would be hard to use direct data analysis on.  We don't have a long table of similar planets that have experienced similar economic and technological conditions, or a table of similar universes and their sizes.

Fortunately, our understanding of the universe has led to a host of predictive models that we can apply to novel situations to result in our predictions of unknown variables. Some of these are mathematical, (F=ma), others are more heuristical (an increase in buyers is correlated with increases in price under specific conditions.)

In this paper we outline the idea of Holistic Estimation Systems, a structured approach of mathematical modeling aimed to help reduce uncertainty of many variables. These have two primary distinctions. First, uncertainty is accounted for in accordance to a specified set of rules. Second, large networks of models are connected and used to understand many variables over time. These ideas can be understood separately (we call these Estimation Models and Holistic Systems), but we think that their combination provides unique and powerful benefits.

Holistic Estimation Systems are meant and optimized for the use of humans making intuitive judgements.
